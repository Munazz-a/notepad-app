# 🧠 Notepad Web App

A rich-text notepad and todo web application built with Quill.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.
The application consists of two main sections: a Note-taking app with rich-text formatting (including images, bold, italic, etc.) and a To-do list for task management. The frontend was designed with the help of AI-generated layouts for an enhanced user experience. Users can seamlessly create, edit, delete, and persist both notes and todos.
